# TCR - Test && (Commit || Revert) application

_A Go implementation of TCR, for practicing baby-steps development, and much more!_

## What is this?

TCR is a programming workflow, standing for **Test && (Commit || Revert)**.

Kent Beck and Oddmund Str√∏mme came up with this concept
in [this post](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864).

Since then several people experimented with this idea.

This repository provides a tool allowing people to use the TCR workflow.

## Why TCR?

Although probably a bit challenging to use on real production code, we found TCR to be quite beneficial when used as a
learning and practicing tool on the katas that we use when doing software craftsmanship coaching.

TCR enforces developing in baby steps, with a strong focus on always keeping the green light on tests. Having a TCR tool
feels a bit like having a coaching assistant constantly enforcing such practices!

We initially came up with a small shell script implementing this workflow, and decided to embed it in each of our katas
so that people can use it if they like. This was a way for us to quickly provide a usable TCR solution. However, shell
scripts are not the best in class when it comes to maintainability and changeability.

For This reason we decided to work on a new implementation of TCR, written in [Go](https://golang.org/) this time.

## Who is this for?

If you are a developer willing to practice TCR workflow and baby-step development either alone, in pair or in a mob,
just download and run this tool with the piece of code on which you want to practice. You can also use it on real
production code if you feel like it!

If you are a technical coach, you can advise participants to your coaching sessions to use it during the sessions.

## Where to start?

### Prerequisites

1. Have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine
2. Have a clone of the git repository containing the code you intend to work on
3. Supported platforms: macOS, Linux and Windows. Refer to [TCR releases page](https://github.com/murex/TCR/releases)
   for supported architectures
4. Supported languages: TCR tool currently works with Java and C++ out of the box (more to come in the future)
5. Have [Java JDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) 11 or later installed for java, or a working C++ compiler
6. Build toolchains:
    - [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) for Java
    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for C++
7. If you're using an IDE, make sure that **your IDE's auto-save is turned off**. TCR is constantly watching for file
   changes in your code, and for this reason it does not get along well with IDE's auto-save features.

### Directory Layout

The TCR tool needs to know where both production code and test code are located.

For this reason it makes some assumptions on the code directory structure.

<details>
  <summary>Directory Layout for Java</summary>

- TCR expects that the root directory for java code is named `java`
- Under the root directory, TCR assumes that the code
  follows [Maven's Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)
- If you intend to use Gradle as the build toolchain, make sure to
  install [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) under the root directory
- If you intend to use Maven as the build toolchain, install [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper)
  under the root directory

In case of doubt you can have a look at [this example](./tcr-engine/testdata/java)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Directory Layout for C++</summary>

- TCR expects that the root directory for C++ code is named `cpp`
- Under the root directory, TCR assumes that the code is organized into 4 subdirectories:
    - `src` - Source code
    - `include` - Header files
    - `test` - Test code
    - `build` - Build files and directories
- TCR expects to find a `CMakeLists.txt` under the root directory

We advise you to have a look at [this example](./tcr-engine/testdata/cpp) to get a better idea of what TCR tool is
expecting to find.

The provided script [cpp_easy_setup.sh](./tcr-engine/testdata/cpp/cpp_easy_setup.sh) should help you have everything
setup and running before running TCR. Among other things it downloads under the `build` directory a working version
of `CMake` that will then be used by the TCR tool.

#### Command line help (all platforms)

Refer to [here](./doc/tcr.md) for TCR command line help and additional options.

## Building TCR on your machine

This section provides information related to TCR tool development environment setup for those who would like to build
TCR tool locally.

<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>

### Clone TCR repository - `Required`

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/murex/TCR.git
$ cd TCR
```

### Install Go SDK - `Required`

TCR is written in Go. This implies having Go compiler and tools installed on your machine.

Simply follow the instructions provided [here](https://go.dev/). Make sure to install **Go version 1.17** or higher.

### Install additional Go tools and utility packages

#### Go IDE - `Optional`

You can check this [link](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/top-7-golang-ides-for-go-developers/)
for a list of recommended IDEs supporting Go language.

#### Cobra library and tools - `Optional`

TCR Go command line options and parameters are managed using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).

The Cobra library download is already dealt with through Go Module dependencies, which means that in most situations you
will not need to worry about installing it.

In case you need to add or modify subcommands, options or parameters, you may want to use the Cobra Generator. In this
situation you can refer to
[Cobra Generator documentation](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/user_guide.md#using-the-cobra-generator)

#### GoReleaser utility - `Optional`

New versions of TCR Go are released through [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/).

You should not need it as long as you don't plan to release a new TCR Go version.

If you do, you can refer to [GoReleaser Installation Instructions](https://goreleaser.com/install/)
for installing it locally on your machine.

In most cases you will not even have to install it locally as TCR-Go new releases are built through
a [GoReleaser GitHub action](.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml).

#### golangci-lint package - `Optional`

We use the Go Linter aggregator [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) to perform various static checks on TCR Go
code.

A [dedicated GitHub action](.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml) triggers execution of golangci-lint every time a new
TCR-Go version is being released.

Although not mandatory, we advise you to install it locally on your machine to check that your changes comply with
golangci-lint rules. Refer to [golangci-lint installation instructions](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)
for installation.

Once golangci-lint is installed, you can run it from the root directory:

```shell
$ make lint
```

Both local run and GitHub Action use [this configuration file](.golangci.yml)

#### Fyne toolkit - `Optional`

The GUI version of TCR-Go is built on top of [Fyne toolkit](https://fyne.io/) for all GUI-related stuff.

Refer to [Fyne Develop](https://developer.fyne.io/) for installation and usage instructions.

You will not need it as long as you're working on the TCR Command Line implementation only.

> ***Note about TCR GUI version***
>
> So far we are only releasing the command line version of TCR.
> We have not reached yet the stage where we could fully automate through a goreleaser GitHub Action
> the cross-compilation and link of TCR with Fyne and its dependencies.
> In the meantime if you wish to give TCR GUI a try, you still can build and run it locally on your machine
> (refer to `Build TCR executable` section below)

### Build TCR executable

To build TCR locally on your machine, simply type the following from the root directory:

```shell
$ make
```

This command generates by default both TCR CLI (in [tcr-cli](./tcr-cli) directory)
and TCR GUI (in [tcr-gui](./tcr-gui) directory) executables, as well as the command help pages (in [doc](./doc)
directory).

<details><summary>To build TCR CLI only</summary>

Either run the following command from the root directory:

```shell
$ make -C ./tcr-cli
```

Or run make from [tcr-cli](./tcr-cli) directory:

```shell
$ cd tcr-cli
$ make
```

</details>

<details><summary>To build TCR GUI only</summary>

Either run the following command from the root directory:

```shell
$ make -C ./tcr-gui
```

Or run make from [tcr-gui](./tcr-gui) directory:

```shell
$ cd tcr-gui
$ make
```

</details>

<details><summary>To generate TCR command markdown documentation</summary>

```shell
$ make doc
```

</details>

</details>
